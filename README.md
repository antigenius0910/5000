# FaceTime doorbell / Instant tech support 
Requirement:
Need a "raspberry pi" and "external web camera" also the "big red button".

Note:
My code will run on mac yosemite, it got re-written from macgeek's original code since a lot of functions doesn't work on yosemite any more.

Instruction:
1. Please put 5000.scpt and capopen.scpt on your desktop
2. Change "facetime number" and "email address" on 5000.scpt  
2. Put big-red-button.c to raspberry pi and don't forgot to compile before using it
